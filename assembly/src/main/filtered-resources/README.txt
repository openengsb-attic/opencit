OpenCIT
-------
The Open Continuous Integration and Test (OpenCIT) server can be used to automatically build, test and deploy projects. It makes it easier for developers to integrate changes and easier for users to obtain fresh builds of a project.

The OpenCIT tries to provide additional benefits compared to other CI & T solutions by building upon the open and highly customizable OpenEngSB platform. Furthermore the OpenCIT itself is also a FOSS project, which provides its users with the possibility to adapt all aspects of the CI & T process.

The domain and connector concept of the OpenEngSB make it possible to define the OpenCIT workflow completely independent of specific tools. Therefore any build, test and deploy tool can be used together with the OpenCIT.

Using OpenCIT
-------------
For an extensive manual see http://opencit.openengsb.org/manual/html-multi/opencit-manual.html

For a quickstart: Start OpenCIT with bin/opencit (or bin/opencit.bat if you are using Microsoft Windows) and use any web browser to open http://localhost:8090/opencit.

OpenEngSB
---------

The OpenCIT is developed based upon the OpenEngSB. Currently the project is
maintained by the same developers working on the OpenEngSB. So if you need help
or further information about the OpenCIT feel free to contact the OpenEngSB
developer team. Further information about the OpenEngSB can be found at 
http://openengsb.org/.
