            To set up a basic OpenCIT setup follow these steps:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    Create a new unpriviledged user on your host. This is not strictly needed, but highly recommended for
                    security purposes
                </listitem>
                <listitem> Unpack the OpenCIT archive in a folder of your choice</listitem>
                <listitem>
                    Execute
                    <programlisting>
                        opencit/bin/karaf.sh server
                    </programlisting>
                    to run the server. To be able to log off from the shell without terminating the server you can user
                    <programlisting>
                        screen opencit/bin/karaf.sh
                    </programlisting>
                    There is also a start script for Microsoft Windows systems in opencit/bin/karaf.bat
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    OpenCIT is now running and listening to port 8095. To configure it and set up projects use any webbrowser
                    to navigate to http://localhost:8095
